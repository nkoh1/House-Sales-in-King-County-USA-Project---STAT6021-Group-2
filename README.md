Objective: To analyze the King County, WA housing dataset on Kaggle and determine the following:
- Resolve any quality issues with the data set by identifying erroneous observations via typo, missing entries, etc, and fixing them.
- Use linear regression on the fixed data set to build a model that explains how prices of homes in King County, WA are based on other variables.
